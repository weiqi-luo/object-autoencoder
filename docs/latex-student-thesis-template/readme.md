# LaTeX thesis git

## Basics
Before downloading / cloning this git or even worse - directly starting with your TeX-_code_,
please take a step back and have a look at our guidelines, tutorials and best-practise examples:

 - [wiki - latex hints](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/info/latex_hints) 
 - [Best practice for thesis writing - staff version] (https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/groups/murola/thesiswriting)
 - [Best practice for thesis writing - student version] (https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/thesiswriting_students)
 - [internal repo wiki](https://git.lsr.ei.tum.de/general/latex-student-thesis-template/wikis/home) __not up to date__
 
If you do not have LaTeX installed yet, please check either the [link above at our wiki](https://wiki.lsr.ei.tum.de/info/latex_hints) or the 
[installation-page](https://git.lsr.ei.tum.de/general/latex-student-thesis-template/wikis/installation).
In case you do not/ cannot install LaTex, [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com/) is an alternative for you, but __ASK YOUR SUPERVISOR FIRST, IF HE IS FINE WITH THAT!!__
 
After Downloading / cloning this repo please be aware of __reading through the included tutorials carefully__ as it 
directly depicts a majority of the most common problems but also errors when struggling with LaTeX.
