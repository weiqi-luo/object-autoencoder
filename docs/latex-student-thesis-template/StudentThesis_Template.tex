\begin{abstract}


Recently, object pose estimation has drawn wide attention as it plays an important role in many robotic applications. In this project, I implemented a deep-learning-based object pose estimation approach proposed in \cite{sundermeyer2018implicit}, which operates on single RGB images and yields a fast and robust estimation result.
